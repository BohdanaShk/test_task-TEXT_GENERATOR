<!-- This code is a web application that provides an API for paraphrasing sentences using permutations of noun phrases (NPs) in a dependency tree passed as a string. The code uses the NLTK library to work with syntax trees and Flask to create a web server.

The function find_phrases recursively iterates through all child nodes of the syntax tree and searches for NPs (noun phrases). All found noun phrases are stored in a list.

The function generate_permutations generates all possible permutations between NPs using the created list of noun phrases.

The final method, paraphrase, processes a request to obtain NP permutations from the tree, using the input data from the tree. The tree is passed as a string, and other parameters such as permutation limit are passed through URL parameters. The function returns a list in JSON format that contains the tree and all possible NP permutations. -->
